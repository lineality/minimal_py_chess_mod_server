TODO:
- comments...add comments into report...
- maybe...office hours in report

- is there a way to reboot the server?
  maybe flask is doomed...what else would work?
  other non-chess games?
    
- do a shakespeare game: 1st folio quotes
- game history now broken? what it shows it report looks wrong...

- set up a testing folding including trial game logs for easy running
e.g. setting up checks, checkmates, stalemates to test. 

- still sometime starting out it glitched getting folders and files
and images set up, but doing a few "new" "board" fixes it...??? 

- add user requests site delete their user cookies option "clear cookies"
- mobile user-id login might be ideal: not connected with IP but connected with that browser cookie
- play vs. various AI systems
- starting from a modified game-log does not work...why?
