TODO:

maybe just go to site/
your move / chess
then you pick name of added game...?
(to avoid restart issue)
use modular endpoints...

- maybe try just ramen for self-made-games...

- make ascii dungeon game based on chess M.A.S.T. system
- 

- maybe...office hours in report, comments... comments into report..

- is there a way to reboot the server?
  maybe flask is doomed...what else would work?
  other non-chess games?
    
- do a shakespeare game: 1st folio quotes
- game history now broken? what it shows it report looks wrong...

- still sometime starting out it glitched getting folders and files
and images set up, but doing a few "new" "board" fixes it...??? 

- add user requests site delete their user cookies option "clear cookies"
- mobile user-id login might be ideal: not connected with IP but connected with that browser cookie
- play chess vs. various AI systems

- redo graphics with vanill python make bitmap/png PIL pillow (python image library)
- redo minimal chess backend
